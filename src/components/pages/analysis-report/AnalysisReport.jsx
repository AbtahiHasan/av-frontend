            This survey was conducted to understand the needs of general people
            regarding confidential support and gather suggestions to improve our
            services of Anonymous Voices. The survey form was created with
            Google Forms and circulated via online platforms. The form was open
            to the public from 5th October 2024 to 21st October 2024 and
            received a total of 162 responses.

            Key Findings
          </h2>
          <p className="text-md opacity-60 leading-relaxed">
            The survey results reveal that while 71% of respondents believe a
            confidential support system is essential, only 16.7% are aware of
            any similar services currently available in Bangladesh. Notably,
            80.2% of participants expressed strong enthusiasm about using a
            platform that offers confidential support, highlighting the need and
            interest in such a service.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-md opacity-60 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Question 1: What is your age range?</strong>
            <br />
            Although the survey was open to all age groups, the vast majority of
            respondents (92%) were between the ages of 18 and 25. A smaller
            portion, 3.7%, fell within the 26 to 30 age range, while 1.2% were
            aged 31 to 35. Respondents over 35 made up 1.9% of the total, and
            only 1.2% of participants were under the age of 18.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md opacity-60 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Question 2: What is your gender?</strong>
            <br />
            The majority of respondents (64.2%) identified as female, while
            35.8% identified as male. Unfortunately, the survey did not capture
            responses from individuals who identify as third gender, indicating
            a lack of representation from this group.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md opacity-60 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Question 3: What is your occupation?</strong>
            <br />
            The majority of respondents (74.7%) identified as students, with an
            additional 13.6% being students who are also employed.
            Service-holders made up 8% of the respondents, while 0.8% were
            business owners. A small percentage, 1.2%, identified as housewives,
            and 1.9% reported being unemployed at the time of the survey.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md opacity-60 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>
              Question 4: Are you aware of the concept of “mental well-being”?
            </strong>
            <br />
            In response, 90.1% of respondents indicated that they are familiar
            with the concept of "mental well-being." Another 9.3% have heard the
            term but lack a clear understanding, while 0.6% are unfamiliar with
            the term altogether.

              Question 5: Have you ever felt the need to talk to someone
              anonymously, sharing thoughts you can’t express to anyone for fear
              of judgement—where someone will simply listen, motivate, and
              encourage you without offering solutions or counselling?
            </strong>{" "}
            <br />
            71% of respondents indicated that they have experienced this need,
            while the remaining 29% said they have not. This suggests that a
            significant majority of users value a non-judgmental, supportive
            space where they can openly express their thoughts without seeking
            direct advice or solutions.

            </strong>{" "}
            <br />
            80.2% of respondents indicated they would be willing to use the
            service if it were offered through a website that allows complete
            anonymity. On the other hand, 19.8% of respondents stated they would
            not use the service under these conditions.

            <br />
            The majority of responses suggested a range between 0.50 taka and 10
            taka. However, a few participants proposed significantly higher
            prices, while some indicated they were unsure and did not provide a
            specific amount.

            83.3% of respondents indicated that they are aware of similar

            <br />
            59.3% of respondents expressed interest in volunteering, while 40.7%
            indicated they would not be willing to volunteer. This suggests that
            a majority of users are open to contributing to the platform's
            mission, potentially offering valuable support to the service.

            The majority of respondents (86.4%) had no prior experience

            <br />
            Many respondents provided valuable suggestions on various aspects of
            the service. Key themes that emerged include:
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Ensuring Confidentiality:</strong> Several users emphasised
            the importance of maintaining strict confidentiality, recommending
            that additional measures be taken to reassure them that their
            personal information and conversations remain private and secure.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Volunteer Recruitment and Training:</strong> Some
            respondents suggested expanding the pool of listeners through
            enhanced recruitment efforts, while others highlighted the need for
            continuous and comprehensive training programs to ensure that
            volunteers are empathetic, well-prepared, and equipped to handle a
            range of emotional situations.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Professional Support:</strong> A number of users expressed
            that even if the platform does not provide professional support, the
            volunteers should have a minimum level of professional knowledge
            with appropriate training and guidance.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> A few participants raised
            concerns about the affordability of the service, suggesting that
            keeping the platform accessible and offering cost-effective options
            could encourage more users to engage with it regularly.

            Conclusion
          </h2>
          <p className="text-md opacity-60 leading-relaxed">
            The survey results highlight a clear demand for confidential mental
            health support services, with 71% of respondents expressing a need
            for a space to share their thoughts anonymously. Despite this
            demand, awareness of similar services in Bangladesh remains low,
            with only 16.7% of participants familiar with existing platforms,
            indicating a significant gap in the availability or promotion of
            such services.
            <br />
            <br />
            The majority of respondents, especially young adults aged 18–25,
            showed strong enthusiasm for using a platform that guarantees
            complete anonymity, with 80.2% willing to engage with such a
            service. This underlines the importance of offering a safe and
            judgement-free environment for users to express their emotions
            without fear of disclosure or stigma.
            <br />
            <br />
            In terms of pricing, respondents suggested a wide range, from as low
            as 0.50 taka to 10 taka per minute, reflecting varying perspectives
            on the cost of the service. Keeping the service cost-effective is
            crucial, as it could play a vital role in making the platform
            accessible to a broader audience.
            <br />
            <br />
            Volunteer engagement emerged as a positive area, with 59.3% of
            respondents showing an interest in contributing to the service.
            However, most respondents lacked prior experience in volunteering
            for similar services, emphasising the need for proper training and
            support. Respondents also highlighted the importance of
            confidentiality, professional guidance for volunteers, and ongoing
            training to ensure that listeners can provide empathetic and
            effective support.
            <br />
            <br />
            In summary, the survey points to a strong need for a confidential,
            accessible, and affordable mental health support platform in
            Bangladesh. Addressing user concerns about confidentiality,
            volunteer training, professional support, and cost-effectiveness
            will be critical for successfully implementing and scaling the
            service.
